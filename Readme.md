I needed a way to automatically upload my pictures to flickr.  I didn't find one so I wrote this small script.

To run this, you'll need:

1) Python 2.x:  http://www.python.org/
2) The flickrAPI for Python:  http://stuvel.eu/flickrapi
3) A flickr api key:  http://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply
